# Audio Metadata Descriptions

The following are explinations of multiple metrics used in audio analysis
More detailed descriptions can be found at [Aalto University's Speech Processing Book](https://speechprocessingbook.aalto.fi/Representations/Representations.html)

**Vocal Fundamental Frequency (VFF)** - The number of times the vocal cords, and the sound produced from them, ocillates per second, in hertz  
**Fo** - The average VFF over a period of time  
**Fhi** - The maximum VFF over a period of time  
**Flo** - The minimum VFF over a period of time  

**Jitter** - The variation in the period (the length of one ocillation) of the VFF. This corresponds to the variation in the pitch of the sound
**Shimmer** - The variation in the amplitude (the height of one ocillation) of the VFF. This corresponds to the variation in the volume of the sound
